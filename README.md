Well, itâ€™s oh-fish-ial. Fish Related Game is a fin-tastic fishing game where players catch fish created by other players. 
You can draw your wildest fish ideas into reality and throw them into a public pool of fish stored in a dynamic JSON database. 
This harnesses the previously untapped potential of using your own player base for the labor of asset creation. 
Fish Related Game is powered by Express.
